# A simple and fast visualization tool for parameter selection during cluster analysis

Given a family of clusterings of a fixed set, it partitions this family using a voting-style algorithm. If the family is parametrized by two numbers (such as the output of running HDBSCAN or DBSCAN with a range of parameters) we display the the partitioning in 2D.

See the python notebook for an example, and https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01436 for a description of the algorithm.
